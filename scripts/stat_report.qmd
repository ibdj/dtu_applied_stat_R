# Data description

Data was collected in Kangerluasunnguaq (Kobbefjord, Nuuk) in Southeast Greenland with in 1 m^2^ plots documenting the vascular plant species abundances and their related abiotic variables, soil moisture and temperature. The vascular plant plant abundance was visually assessed by an expert and recorded on a modified Braun-Blanquet scale. Soil temperature was measured with a generic thermometer. Soil moisture was collected a ThetaProbe.

# Scientific question

-   Does different species of shrub have different preferences for soil moisture and/or temperature?

-   

# Analysis

# Appendix

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
