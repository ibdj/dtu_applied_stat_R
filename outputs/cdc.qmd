## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

```{r}
setwd()
cdc <- read_csv("data/cdc.csv")

```{r}
hist(cdc$weight_kg, , las = 1, main = "Weight of participants (kg)", col = 2, density = 15, xlab = "Bins of weight (kg)")
```

You can add options to executable code like this
